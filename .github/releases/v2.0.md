# Release Notes: KCstudio Launchpad v2.0

**Usability and Robustness Update**

Version 2.0 focuses on quality of life. This update unifies the toolkit into a cohesive platform rather than just a collection of scripts. The interaction logic has been rewritten to be significantly more stable. Tools no longer exit abruptly on minor errors, keeping you in the flow. The goal was to remove friction from daily operations and prevent common configuration mistakes.

### Improved Workflow
* **File Transfer:** Removed the need for `scp`. You can now upload backups or reports to a secure TUI-Transfer link directly from the menu.
* **User Management:** Provisioning new users or revoking access is now a guided menu process in `SecureCore`, replacing manual command-line work.
* **Restoration:** You can now restore a project by providing a direct URL to a backup archive. The toolkit handles download, extraction, and placement automatically.

### Operational Safety
* **Error Handling:** The scripts are now state-aware and more robust, catching errors gracefully instead of crashing the session.
* **Config Validation:** The new NGINX editor shortcut enforces a syntax check before reloading the service to prevent downtime.
* **Data Hygiene:** New defaults for log rotation and backup retention prevent disk space issues on long-running servers.
* **Alerting:** You can now configure the server to dispatch notifications to a webhook when critical system errors occur.

### Interface Changes
* **Traffic Stats:** `ManageApp` now parses logs to provide a quick summary of hit counts (24h/30d) for all domains and apps.
* **Consistency:** All tools now share the same visual layout, input prompts, and navigation structure.

Enjoy!
